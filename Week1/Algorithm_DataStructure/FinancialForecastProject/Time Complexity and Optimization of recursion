Time Complexity of the Recursive Algorithm

The recursive algorithm calls itself once for each period.
So, if there are n periods, the time complexity is:
O(n)
This means the time taken increases linearly as the number of periods increases.



How to Optimize the Recursive Solution
Instead of recursion, we can:

->Use iteration (loop):
We can replace recursion with a loop that repeatedly multiplies the value for each period.
This avoids many function calls and reduces memory usage.

->Apply the direct formula:
We can directly calculate the future value using the formula:

!*future_value=initial_value√ó(1+growth_rate)^n*!
 
This gives the result in one step, without needing loops or recursion.
