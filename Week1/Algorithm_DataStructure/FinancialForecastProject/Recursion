Recursion is a process where a function calls itself to solve smaller parts of the same problem.
It continues until it reaches a base case (a condition where it stops calling itself).

How Recursion Simplifies Problems?
->It breaks a big problem into smaller, easier subproblems.
->It is useful for problems with repeating patterns.
->Makes code shorter and easier to understand for tasks like:

   *Factorial
   *Fibonacci series
   *Tree or graph traversal
   *Solving puzzles (e.g., Tower of Hanoi)
