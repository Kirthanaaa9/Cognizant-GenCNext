Compare the Time Complexity of Linear and Binary Search Algorithms
Linear Search:
 Time complexity: O(n)
 The time increases directly with the number of products.
 It does not require the data to be sorted.
Binary Search:
 Time complexity: O(log n)
 The time increases slowly even when the number of products is large.
 It requires the product list to be sorted.


Which Algorithm is More Suitable for the Platform and Why?
For an e-commerce platform, binary search is generally more suitable because it is much faster,
especially when the product list is large. Since products are usually stored in sorted order by
name or ID, binary search can take advantage of this and perform searches efficiently. Linear 
search may still be useful in small lists, like a user's shopping cart, where the overhead of 
sorting is unnecessary.
